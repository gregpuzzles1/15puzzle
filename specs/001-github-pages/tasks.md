# Tasks: GitHub Pages Deployment

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-github-pages/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: User explicitly requested tests to "bring out any issues with existing code". All test tasks included below are MANDATORY for this feature.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Flutter project**: `lib/`, `test/`, `.github/workflows/` at repository root
- **Web assets**: `web/` directory
- **Build output**: `build/web/` (generated, deployed to gh-pages branch)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and repository configuration

- [ ] T001 Verify Flutter SDK version ≥3.10.0 and Dart ^3.10.0 are installed
- [ ] T002 Verify repository is clean with no uncommitted changes on 001-github-pages branch
- [ ] T003 [P] Create `.github/workflows/` directory structure for CI/CD workflows

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core configuration that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Configure GitHub repository settings: enable GitHub Pages, set source to gh-pages branch
- [ ] T005 Configure GitHub Actions permissions: enable "Read and write permissions" for workflows
- [ ] T006 [P] Update pubspec.yaml to include web platform if not already present
- [ ] T007 [P] Verify existing dependencies (audioplayers, confetti, cupertino_icons) are web-compatible

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Deploy Game to GitHub Pages (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Automated CI/CD pipeline that deploys game to https://gregpuzzles1.github.io/15puzzle/

**Independent Test**: Push code to main branch → workflow runs → game accessible and playable at live URL

### Tests for User Story 1 (MANDATORY)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - game is live and accessible via web browser

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Responsive Layout (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Game adapts to desktop (≥1024px), tablet (768-1023px), and mobile (<768px) viewports

**Independent Test**: Open deployed site on different viewport sizes and verify appropriate scaling without scrolling

### Tests for User Story 2 (MANDATORY)

- [ ] T034 [US2] Implement getBoardSize() with MediaQuery to calculate optimal board size
- [ ] T035 [US2] Add breakpoint logic: ≥1024px → min(520, available), 768-1023px → min(480, available), <768px → min(available, 340)
- [ ] T036 [US2] Update all boardSize references in build() method to call getBoardSize(context)
- [ ] T037 [US2] Test responsive behavior locally: `flutter run -d chrome` and resize window
- [ ] T038 [US2] Verify tile sizes: mobile (340/4=85px), tablet (480/4=120px), desktop (520/4=130px) all ≥44px
- [ ] T039 [US2] Run `flutter test` to verify responsive tests now pass (TDD: green phase)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 2 should be fully functional - game is playable on mobile, tablet, and desktop

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Loading Screen (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Minimal animated spinner appears immediately (<500ms) during Flutter initialization

**Independent Test**: Open deployed site with Slow 3G throttling and verify spinner appears before game loads

### Tests for User Story 3 (MANDATORY)

> **NOTE: Write loading screen tests BEFORE implementing**

- [ ] T045 [P] [US3] Add test to verify #loading div exists in web/index.html
- [ ] T046 [P] [US3] Add test to verify loading spinner has correct inline styles (position: fixed, display: flex)

- [ ] T057 [US3] If old browser detected, replace body with "Unsupported Browser" message
- [ ] T058 [US3] Open lib/main.dart and add `import 'dart:html' as html;` at top (web-only import)
- [ ] T059 [US3] In _PuzzleGameState.initState(), add SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback(() {...})
- [ ] T060 [US3] Inside callback, call `html.document.querySelector('#loading')?.remove();`
- [ ] T061 [US3] Test locally: `flutter run -d chrome` and verify spinner appears briefly then disappears
- [ ] T062 [US3] Test with throttling: Chrome DevTools → Network → Slow 3G → hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] T063 [US3] Verify spinner appears within 500ms and transitions smoothly when game loads
- [ ] T064 [US3] Test JavaScript disabled: disable JS in browser settings → verify noscript message shows

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 3 should be fully functional - loading UX is polished and professional

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final validation, documentation, and edge case handling

- [ ] T070 [P] Run `flutter analyze` to verify no linting errors or warnings
- [ ] T071 [P] Run full test suite: `flutter test` and verify all tests pass (responsive + loading + compatibility)
- [ ] T072 [P] Update README.md with deployed site URL: https://gregpuzzles1.github.io/15puzzle/
- [ ] T086 [P] Verify HTTPS enforcement: navigate to http://gregpuzzles1.github.io/15puzzle/ and confirm auto-redirect to https://
- [ ] T073 [P] Add "Play Online" badge/link to README.md
- [ ] T074 Manual cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Safari/Edge on desktop (full game playthrough each)
- [ ] T075 Manual mobile testing: Chrome DevTools → iPhone SE, Pixel 5, iPad (verify touch targets ≥44px)
- [ ] T076 Manual performance testing: Slow 3G throttling → verify <5s interactive, spinner visible
- [ ] T077 Manual audio testing: verify tile sounds, new game chime, win fanfare (may prompt for permission)
- [ ] T078 Manual confetti testing: verify win animation smooth (60fps), acceptable on low-end devices
- [ ] T079 Edge case validation: extremely small viewport (<320px) → verify game handles gracefully
- [ ] T080 Edge case validation: refresh mid-game → verify game resets correctly
- [ ] T081 Edge case validation: network error during load → verify error handling (if implemented)
- [ ] T082 Verify all 7 success criteria from spec.md (SC-001 through SC-007)
- [ ] T083 Document any known limitations in README.md (audio autoplay policies, confetti performance)
- [ ] T084 Create GitHub release/tag with version number and deployment notes
- [ ] T085 Update copilot-instructions.md if any new patterns/conventions emerged during implementation

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### User Story Completion Order (with dependencies)

```
Setup (Phase 1) → Foundational (Phase 2)
                        ↓
                     US1 (P1) [MVP] ← MUST COMPLETE FIRST
                        ↓
        ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
        ↓                               ↓
     US2 (P2)                        US3 (P3)
   [Responsive]                   [Loading Screen]
        ↓                               ↓
        └───────────────┬───────────────┘
                        ↓
              Polish (Phase 6)
```

**Key Dependencies**:
- **US1 MUST be complete** before US2 or US3 (need live deployment to test responsive/loading)
- US2 and US3 are **independent** and can be implemented in parallel (different files)
- Polish phase depends on **all user stories complete**

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within US1** (can work simultaneously):
- T008, T009, T010 (test files) + T012-T020 (workflow file) - different files

**Within US2** (can work simultaneously):
- T026-T030 (test files) + T032-T036 (main.dart) - if careful with merge conflicts

**Within US3** (can work simultaneously):
- T045-T047 (HTML tests) + T049-T057 (web/index.html) + T058-T060 (lib/main.dart)

**Polish Phase** (highly parallel):
- T070, T071, T072, T073 can all run in parallel (different files/commands)
